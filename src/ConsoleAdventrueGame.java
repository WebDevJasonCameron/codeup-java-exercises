/**
 * Console Adventure Game!
 *
 *    -   Using what you've learned so far in the Java I module, we're going to create a
 *        classic text-based RPG game. These types of online role-playing games date back
 *        to the 70's and solely rely on a text-based interface. In this case, we'll be
 *        using Java to run this game in our console.
 *
 *    -   The idea is that your game will prompt the user, who will then input answers
 *        through the console (using the Scanner class). How the game changes depending
 *        on their answer is completely up to you! Below are a list of suggested features
 *        to get you started:
 *
 *    3.  Ask if the user is ready to start. If they type in "yes", start the game.
 *
 *    4.  Ask the user for their name. Store this as a variable to personalize the adventure.
 *
 *    5.  A classic RPG will have the hero going through different scenarios and battling their
 *        enemies.
 *
 *    6.  Display enemy stats and hero stats. Properties and values can be assigned by you.
 *
 *        --- For example: Health, Attack Points, etc.
 *
 *    7.  Decide on what actions your hero can take.
 *
 *    8.  Attack (decreases enemyHealth)
 *
 *    9.  Drink potion (adds to heroHealth)
 *
 *    10. Run? (ends the game)
 *
 *    11. Keep asking for user input until the enemyHealth reaches 0, then end the game.
 *
 * BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS - BONUS
 *
 *    B1.  Allow the user to specify hero stats and enemy stats.
 *
 *    B2.  Automate an enemyAttack after each time the hero takes a turn.
 *    B3.  End the game if either heroHealth or enemyHealth drops to 0.
 *    B4.  Indicate how many potions your hero starts with. Decrement this number each time 'Use Potion' action is used.
 *
 * Remember that these are only suggestions. Feel free to get creative and have fun!!
